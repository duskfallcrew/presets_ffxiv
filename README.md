# Re:Shade Presets by Duskfallcrew

Works for Dawntrail

A collection of reshade presets that we've been working on. We're not perfect at them, and we're planning on learning more as time goes on.

You'll need ReShade installed: [Reshade](https://reshade.me/)

All shaders included were downloaded from Reshade, [and it's familiar shader repositories](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/ReShade#List_of_known_shader_repositories)

IF you'd like to donate: [![ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/Z8Z8L4EO)

Includes shaders, so credit to every single one that I used… Credit is at the bottom, eventually I'll add download links. Textures are NOW included because Pirate Shaders had some with. Feel free to slap me if I'm missing anything.

The "OFF" one my be incorrectly rendered as I borrowed it without thinking from somewhere else. 

Lisc: Don't sell this for money, because I'd cry. Don't use this for anything toxic or against laws and regulations.

You CAN: Remix, redo and fix anything stupid I've done and re-name.
